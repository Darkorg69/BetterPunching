# Better Punching
A minecraft mod, making punching and breaking blocks much more realistic!

## Features
* If you (open-hand) punch a block, you can't harvest, you will hurt yourself.
* You can no longer punch wood at the start of the game, you need to first get a flint axe.
* Trying to break a block with no tool or the wrong tool will result in never ending breaking.
* Glass of any kind now breaks instantly and will hurt you badly if you break it with bare hands.
* You can now right click flint onto any stone block in order to sharpen it and make tools out of it.

## Why this mod?
I really like playing realism based modpacks, so I decided to make the game more believeble, as punching  
and breaking blocks is one of the main things all players do from the beginning, to the end of the game.

## Aren't there mods out there that have the same feature as yours?
Yes, there are! But not a single one of them features what my mod features, and this is simplicity!  
I have made the mod so it is as lightweight as possible without any bloat, also trying to be compatible with any modpack.

## Important

## Is "x" mod compatible?
**If "x" registers their tools with proper blockHarvestType, yes it "should" be 100% compatible.**  
**If "x" registers their blocks with proper blockTags and harvestToolTypes yes it "should" be 100% compatible.**

## Features to be implemented soon:
* Adding a configuration to the mod.
* Add a option to remove all wooden and stone tools for more realism.

## Compatible mods: (Tested on 1.16.5)
* Dynamic Trees
* Probably a lot more, I will be slowly adding to the list as I test out new mods.
