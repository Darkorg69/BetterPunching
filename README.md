# BetterPunching (latest-release-1.16.5)
A minecraft mod, making punching and breaking blocks much more realistic!

**Features**
* You can no longer punch wood at the start of the game, you need to first get an axe.
* Glass of any kind now breaks instantly.
* Breaking glass with hands will result in pain.
* If you (open-hand) punch a block, you can't harvest, you will hurt yourself.
* Trying to break a block with no tool or the wrong tool will result in neverending breaking.

## Why this mod?
I really like playing realism based modpacks, so I decided to make the game more believeble, 
as punching and breaking blocks is one of the main things all players do from the beginning, to the end.

## Aren't there mods out there that have the same feature as yours?
Yes, there are! But not a single one of them features what my mod features, and all of them are full of many other features,
like blocks, items, tools, mechanics etc... This mod simply adds a single simple realistic game mechanic.

## Important
**Installing this mod into vannilla minecraft, without other companion mods, might result in inability of getting wood.**
**You can get wood if you get an axe or enough wood to craft an axe from the bonus chest at world spawn!**

## Notice
Any incompatibilities/compatibilities shall be reported in the git issues!

## Is "x" mod compatible?
* **If "x" registers their blocks with proper blockTags and harvestToolTypes yes it "should" be 100% compatible**
* **If "x" registers their tools with proper blockHarvestType, yes it "should" be 100% compatible**
* Incompatibilities should be expected.

### Compatible mods: (I will only update the list for the latest supported minecraft version 1.16.5)
- List for 1.16.5:
 *None tested for now...*
### Incompatible mods: (I will only update the list for the latest supported minecraft version 1.16.5)
Incompatible with any mod that reworks breaking mechanics, loading two mods which alter the same mechanic
will result in unexpected behaviour or probably crash!
