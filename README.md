# Better Punching
A mod, overhauling punching and breaking mechanics in a popular block game!

# Notice
**This mod is for *Forge* only.**

## Mod Features
* You can't punch cactus with hands if you don't sneak.
* Most blocks will now require you to use their proper tool in order to break them.
* You can no longer punch wood at the start of the game, you need to first craft a hatchet. 
* Punching any glass block will result in instant shatter or the glass and you will get the **Bleeding** effect.
* Punching any block you can't harvest will hurt you and you will gain **Mining Fatigue** and **Weakness** debuffs.

## Why this mod?
I really like playing realism based modpacks, so I decided to make the game more believeble, because  
punching and breaking blocks is the main thing all players do from the beginning, to the end of the game.  

## Aren't there mods out there that have the same feature as yours?
Yes, there are! But all of them add too much bloat, and are incompatible with most modpacks.  
I made this mod so it is as lightweight as possible, whilst trying to be compatible with any mod/modpack.

## Important
* Every feature is 100% configurable in the config file.
* Mod configuration file is located in ***saves/world/server_config***!
* If you have a bright suggestion, please suggest it, into mod's github repository.

## Is "x" mod compatible?
**Every mod out there should be compatible, if you happen to encounter a bug, please report it.**

## Features to be implemented soon:
* Add logic for more blocks?

## Known bugs: 
**None**
