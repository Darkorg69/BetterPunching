# BetterPunching (latest-release-1.16.5)
A minecraft mod, making punching and breaking blocks much more realistic!

## Features
* You can no longer punch wood at the start of the game, you need to first get a flint axe.
* In order to obtain a flint axe:  
You need to sharpen flint by right clicking any stone block with a flint in your main hand. (sharping flint has a 25% success chance).  
Craft 3 pieces of sharp flint into a sharp flint axe head.  
Craft 2 string into 1 rope, then use 2 ropes to make a rope binding.  
Harvest a stick from any leaves. (Leaves now have 25% chance to grant you either 1 or 2 sticks)  
Now use the sharp flint axe head, the rope binding and the stick to make your first axe.
* Flint pickaxe is made similarly but you got to obtain wood first and craft in a crafting table since the crafting is not 2x2 but 3x3.
* Glass of any kind now breaks instantly and will hurt you badly if you break it with bare hands.
* If you (open-hand) punch a block, you can't harvest, you will hurt yourself.
* Trying to break a block with no tool or the wrong tool will result in never ending breaking.

## Why this mod?
I really like playing realism based modpacks, so I decided to make the game more believeble, 
as punching and breaking blocks is one of the main things all players do from the beginning, to the end.

## Aren't there mods out there that have the same feature as yours?
Yes, there are! But not a single one of them features what my mod features, and this is simplicity!
Mod is lightweight as possible without any bloat.

## Important
**Highly suggested to use JEI to see all recipes.**  
**Since version 1.1.0 mod should be compatible with most mods which adds blocks, tools etc... but bugs are always to be expected.**  
**If you happen to see a bug, please report it, into mod's github repository.**  
**If you have a bright suggestion, please suggest it, into mod's github repository.**

## Is "x" mod compatible?
* **If "x" registers their blocks with proper blockTags and harvestToolTypes yes it "should" be 100% compatible**
* **If "x" registers their tools with proper blockHarvestType, yes it "should" be 100% compatible**

## Features to be implemented soon:
* Add missing flint tools - shovel, sword, hoe.
* Adding a config to the mod to be more modular.
* Adding a configurable feature to remove wooden and stone tools, to add more realism to the mod.

## Compatible mods: (Tested on 1.16.5)
* Dynamic Trees
* Probably a lot more, I will be slowly adding to the list as I test out new mods.

## Incompatible mods: (I will only update the list for the latest supported minecraft version 1.16.5)
Incompatible with any mod that reworks breaking mechanics, loading two mods which alter the same mechanic
will result in unexpected behaviour or probably crash!
