# Better Punching
A mod, overhauling punching and breaking mechanics in a popular block game!

## Features
* Most blocks now require you to use their proper tool in order to break them.
* You can no longer punch wood at the start of the game, you need to first get an axe.  
* Glass of any kind now breaks instantly and you will start ***bleeding*** if you break it with hands.
* If you (open-hand) punch cactus, without sneaking first, you are going to get a ***splinter*** effect.
* If you (open-hand) punch a block, you can't harvest, you will hurt yourself and gain Mining Fatigue and Weakness debuffs.

## Items
* This mod only adds 2 new items which are the **Bone and Flint Hatchets**
* The hatchets are basically smaller axes, which have half of normal axe stats.

## Why this mod?
I really like playing realism based modpacks, so I decided to make the game more believeble, as punching  
and breaking blocks is one of the main things all players do from the beginning, to the end of the game.

## Aren't there mods out there that have the same feature as yours?
Yes, there are! But all of them add too much bloat, and are incompatible with most modpacks.  
So I made this mod so it is as lightweight as possible, whilst trying to be compatible with any mod/modpack.

## Important
**Every feature is 100% configurable in the config file**  
**Refer to the wiki if you don't know what the mod does!**  
**Mod configuration file is located in saves/world/server_config!**  
**If you happen to see a bug, please report it, into mod's github repository.**  
**If you have a bright suggestion, please suggest it, into mod's github repository.**  

## Is "x" mod compatible?
**If "x" registers their tools with proper blockHarvestType, yes it "should" be 100% compatible.**  
**If "x" registers their blocks with proper blockTags and harvestToolTypes yes it "should" be 100% compatible.**

## Features to be implemented soon:
* **Add logic for more blocks?**

## Compatible mods: (Tested on 1.16.5)
Probably every mod out there, if there are any incompatibilities, report them in GitHub, so they can be fixed or atleast noted in the mod description.
