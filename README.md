# BetterPunching 1.0.0 - alpha
Add realism to punching and breaking blocks.

-Wood can only be harvested with an axe, punching it will result in pain.
-If you break glass with bare hands you will get hurt... badly. (Because logic)
-Glass breaks instantly no matter how you break it, because real glass does this. Try if you want. (don't actually, pls)
-Every block (except intant_break blocks and soft blocks) now require you to break it with it's proper tool.
-Soft blocks are mostly shovel blocks.
Example: You can still break soft blocks like dirt,sand,gravel,leaves,etc... 
basically every blocks which would normally drop in vannila minecraft if broken with an open hand.
But in order to break stone you need a pickaxe. In order to chop wood you need an axe etc...

###NOTE: THIS MOD DOESN'T ADD ANY NEW ITEMS/BLOCKS/TOOLS. IT ONLY CHANGES THE BLOCK BREAKING MECHANIC.
If you install it on vannila minecraft, you cannot get wood, without cheating.
(Maybe you can if you get lucky and get an axe from the bonus chest).
So you need to install a mod which adds some tools which you can craft from materials
you can get without puching hard blocks. 
There are plenty of mods our there that add basic primitive tools 
and very very soon I will release one myself, which will be a companion mod for this one.

This mod is open-sourced, still W.I.P and not guaranteed to be stable or to work
with any mod adding new blocks, block break mechanics, tooltypes etc...
Major bugs, crashes etc... can be expected at any time using this mod.
Any incompatibilities/compatibilities shall be reported in the git issues.
I will try to fill a list with every compatible and uncompatible mod out there
but I won't test every single one of them.

#Why this mod?
I like playing realism based modpacks, and every single one of them except a few start with chopping wood with bare hands.
I wanted to make breaking blocks in general more beliveable, but there wasn't a properly made mod out there, so I took things in my hands.

#Every mod which adds properly registered blocks with properly registered valid tools "SHOULD" be compatible.
###COMPATIBLE MODS:
None tested for now...
###UNCOMPATIBLE MODS: (Surely incompatible with every mod which changes block-breaking mechanics)
None tested for now...


###CREDITS: People which helped me with ideas,works,code and anything in general, that deserve to take credit no matter how big or small their help was.
